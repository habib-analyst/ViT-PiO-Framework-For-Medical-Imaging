## 📋 Project Overview

This project contains three AI models trained to detect and classify medical conditions from image data:

1. **Brain Model** - Alzheimer's vs Stroke Classification
2. **Lung Model** - Lung Cancer vs Pneumonia Classification
3. **Skin Model** - Skin Disease Classification (Melanoma, Tinea)

## 🏗️ Architecture

All models use a hybrid approach combining:
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** - For patch-based image understanding
- **Perceiver IO** - For efficient cross-attention mechanisms
- **Data Augmentation** - Random flip, rotation, zoom, and contrast adjustments

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Running the Models

Each model can be trained independently:

**Brain Model:**
```bash
cd "Brain Model/Brain Model"
python neuro_code.py
```

**Lung Model:**
```bash
cd "Lung Model/Lung Model"
python lung_code.py
```

**Skin Model:**
```bash
cd "Skin Model/Skin Model"
python skin_code.py
```

## 📊 Model Performance

All models include:
- **Early Stopping** - Prevents overfitting
- **Learning Rate Reduction** - Adapts learning during training
- **Dropout Regularization** - 50% dropout in classification head
- **Data Validation** - Separate validation and test sets

## 🔧 Configuration

Models are configured with:
- **Input Shape**: 224×224×3 (RGB images)
- **Patch Size**: 16×16 pixels
- **Transformer Heads**: 4
- **Perceiver IO Blocks**: 3
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Learning Rate**: 1e-4 (with adaptive reduction)
- **Epochs**: 5+ (with early stopping)

## 📈 Training Pipeline

1. **Data Loading** - Load NumPy arrays from NPYF/NPYFile directories
2. **Preprocessing** - Expand dims, normalize to [0,1], apply augmentation
3. **Model Building** - ViT encoder + Perceiver IO blocks
4. **Training** - With callbacks for early stopping and LR reduction
5. **Evaluation** - Test accuracy and loss metrics
6. **Visualization** - Learning curves and training history plots

## 💾 Model Outputs

Trained models are saved as HDF5 files:
- `Brain Model/Model/vit_perceiver_io_model.h5`
- `Lung Model/Model/vit_perceiver_io_model.h5`
- `Skin Model/Model/skin_disease_vit_perceiver_io_model.h5`

Classification reports are saved as:
- `*_classification_report.txt`

## 📝 Dataset Format

Datasets are organized as:
- **Training**: `*/train/Class1/` and `*/train/Class2/`
- **Validation**: `*/validation/Class1/` and `*/validation/Class2/`
- **Testing**: `*/test/Class1/` and `*/test/Class2/`

Preprocessed data is stored as NumPy arrays:
- `X_train.npy`, `y_train.npy`
- `X_validation.npy`, `y_validation.npy`
- `X_test.npy`, `y_test.npy`

## 🔍 Utility Scripts

- **CSVF.py** - CSV file processing and dataset management
- **EM2.py** - Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- **FCS1.py** - Feature computation and scaling
- **NPYF.py** - NumPy array file I/O operations
- **pi.py** - Preprocessing interface and pipeline

## 📧 Notes

- All paths use relative directories for cross-platform compatibility
- Models require GPU for efficient training (TensorFlow with CUDA)
- CPU training is supported but significantly slower
- Each model training takes approximately 10-20 minutes per epoch
